# 1 - Business Understanding:

    In this section, provide an introduction to algorithmic trading in the Forex markets. Explain the relevance and importance of the project.

# 2 - Analytic Approach:

    Describe the approach you will take to solve the problem. This could include an overview of the data science and machine learning techniques you plan to use.

# 3 - Data Requirements:

    List the data you need for your project, such as historical Forex market data, currency pair prices, and any other relevant data sources.

# 4 - Data Collection:

    Show how to collect data for your project. You might want to provide Python code examples for data retrieval, using libraries like Pandas or APIs for financial data.

# 5 - Data Understanding:

    Utilize econometric tools, time series analysis, and statistical tests to explore the data. Provide code examples for performing these tasks.

# 6 - Data Preparation:

    Discuss data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature scaling.

# 7 - Features Extraction:

    Explain how to extract relevant features from the data, which will be used as inputs for your machine learning models.

# 8 - Modeling:

    Present the mathematical models you mentioned (multilinear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, deep learning with LSTM and transformers). Provide code examples for training and testing these models.

# 9 - Model Evaluation:

    Describe the evaluation metrics you'll use to assess the performance of your models. Present results for each model, including accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

# 10 - Inserting Models into a Trading Strategy:

    Explain how to integrate the machine learning models into a trading strategy. Provide code for generating trade signals based on model predictions.

# 11 - Backtesting:

    Show how to backtest your trading strategies using the Backtrader library. Discuss the performance of your strategies.

# 12 - Deployment with Flask and Dash-Plotly:

    Describe how to deploy your model and trading strategy using Flask and Dash-Plotly. This may include creating a web application for live trading or strategy monitoring.
